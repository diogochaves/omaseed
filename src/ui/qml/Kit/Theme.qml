// The `Theme` every QML file reads: the C++ theme (`ThemeBase`, src/integration/Theme.hpp),
// every role and size as it is, plus a `space()` a binding follows (#156, docs/DECISIONS.md
// C28). A binding re-evaluates for the properties it reads, and a call to a C++ method reads
// none: as a C++ method, `Theme.space(8)` kept the value of its first run when the shell's
// base size changed. This one reads `spaceScale` (NOTIFY changed), so every binding made of
// `Theme.space(…)` alone follows a base-size change live, with no call site changed.
ThemeBase {
    /// Spacing in spec pixels, scaled by `[spacing] scale` and the base size.
    function space(px: real): int {
        return spaceAt(px, spaceScale);
    }
